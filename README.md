This site contains my work portfolio and personal blog. It's generated from text files (.org) using ox-html engine in Emacs. The publishing backend has been customised to mimic typesetting in [Tufte Pandoc CSS](https://github.com/jez/tufte-pandoc-css) by Jake Zimmerman.
Otherwise it's style references Butterick's practical typography and [Experimental Jetset](https://experimentaljetset.nl).
