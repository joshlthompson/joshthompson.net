In April 2022, UNESCO placed Stonehenge's World Heritage Status at risk due to the impact of a proposed road-tunnel within it's boundaries.  The designation is thought to be worth 
      <a href="https://unesco.org.uk/projects/national-value-of-unesco-to-the-united-kingdom">£150 million per annum to GDP</a>.
    </p>


    <p>
I was to lead development of a Digital Twin of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site (WHS) so ambassadors to UNESCO could evaluate the WHS before and after completion of the tunnel project.
    </p>


    <p>
This would be the first time a Significant Infrastructure proposal would be represented as a Digital Twin in the UK. In total the 36
      <sup>2</sup> km environment would ingest a terabyte of planning data. 
    </p>


    <p>
My task was to ensure our product was valuable to our client and viable given the constraints of our business. I was expected to contribute a deep knowledge of our customer and data about how users engage with the product. Moving forwards, I was expected to track industry trends and the competitive landscape and adapt our product strategy, accordingly.
